***Real-time Indoor Positioning System***

Plott is an open-source project written in JavaScript working to create a modular high accuracy indoor positioning system
using WiFi fingerprinting. The goal of Plott is to create an API that is capable of tracking a targeted device within 1 foot
of its actual location and easily integrate with existing JavaScript web mapping libraries via GeoJson. In addition to the
technical goals of Plott, the project is being developed to preform geospatial analysis on K9 Nose Work training techniques.
